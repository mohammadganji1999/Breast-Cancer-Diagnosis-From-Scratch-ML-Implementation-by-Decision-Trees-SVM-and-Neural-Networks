# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-From-Scratch-ML-Implementation-by-Decision-Trees-SVM-and-Neural-Networks
A comprehensive implementation of three fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch for breast cancer tumor classification. This project demonstrates deep understanding of ML fundamentals by building Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

This project implements three classic machine learning algorithms from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as either Benign or Malignant based on 9 cellular features.

Key Achievements:

     96%+ accuracy achieved with Neural Network

    Pure NumPy implementation (no sklearn/ml libraries)

    Comprehensive model comparison

    Complete backpropagation from scratch

    Performance visualization

    
    -Dataset

    The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset contains 699 samples with 9 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.


    Key Implementation Highlights
1. Pure NumPy Implementation

No machine learning libraries used - all algorithms coded from scratch:

    Decision Tree: Manual Gini impurity calculation, recursive splitting

    SVM: Hinge loss optimization with gradient descent

    Neural Network: Complete forward/backward propagation

2. Custom Data Processing

    Manual train-test split implementation

    Custom normalization function

    Missing value handling

3. Educational Value

Perfect for learning:

    How Decision Trees actually work internally

    SVM optimization from first principles

    Neural network backpropagation mathematics
